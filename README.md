# React Basic Components

This is an example project that demonstrates how to create basic React components using Storybook. It showcases a set of reusable UI components that can be used to build larger applications.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the components on the following URL:[ https://ehsanrashidi.github.io/react-basic-components/?path=/story/reactbasictemplate-card--card-example-3](https://ehsanrashidi.github.io/react-basic-components/?path=/docs/reactbasictemplate-card--docs)

## Installation

To use these components in your own project, you can install the package from npm:
npm install react-basic-components

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can import the components and use them in your React application:
<pre>
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Button } from 'react-basic-components';
import * as bc from 'react-basic-components'
....
</pre>
## Development

To get started with development, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

<pre>
  
  git clone https://github.com/ehsanrashidi/react-basic-components.git
  cd react-basic-components
  npm install
  
</pre>

You can then start Storybook by running the following command:
npm run storybook

This will start a local development server at http://localhost:6006/ where you can view and edit the components.
